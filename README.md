# VertaMeet
Proof of concept software intended to improve the company culture of Vertafore.

This program is like a Meetup.com specialized for Vertafore. It's intention is to get people to meet up cross department and
do fun activities together. For example, the hiking interest group could collaborate on VertaMeet to get dev and sales
employees together for weekly hikes.
